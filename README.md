### Instructions: Using Crystal Rewards

1. **Create a reward**
   To create a reward, use the command:
   /crystalrewards create <amount>
   - <amount>: Specifies the amount that will be credited when the reward is collected.
   - Set up an Armorstand or Playhead for yourself and use the command.

2. **Display of the rewards**
   - Player Heads: Use player heads from head plugins or via commands to create the rewards.
   - Armor Stands: Armor Stands offer a visually impressive way to display rewards, but you should have special models in the resource pack to make it look nicer or you can position them nicely.

3. **Interaction with rewards**
   - Players can interact with the ‚ÄúRewards‚Äù by clicking on the Player Head or Armor Stand. The specified amount will be added to the player's Econix account and the player will receive a customizable message.

4. **Example**
   To create a reward of 500(e.g. $), enter the following command:
   
```
/crystalrewards create 500
```
   A reward will be created at the next Armor-stand/Playerhead.
